# Echo Chambers Model 

Model of echo chambers and polarisation I developed in Python for my MRes thesis: Simulating Online Echo Chambers Using an Agent Based Model: Information Diffusion, Social Influence and Opinion Change, University of Glasgow (2018-2019). 

It is an abstract ABM that has not been calibrated (yet) so it serves as theoretical approach to opinion polarisation and echo chambers. One of the main contributions of this model is the online engagement levels of agents, unique to each of the agents and determinant of information cascades, unlike previous models where agents will have the same likelihood of engaging with others online. This produces very interesting opinion dynamics as well as echo chambers.

I'm currently in the process of running sensitivity analysis and eventually validating it with data. Hope you enjoy the HTML interface and do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.
